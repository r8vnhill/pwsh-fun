# `Fun.OCD`

This module exists **solely** because I have OCD.

It's not a product. It's not a framework. It's not even sane.  
It's just a bunch of PowerShell commands I use to keep *my* systems clean, organized, and just the way I like them.

Also, it's a backup. Also, a reference. Also, maybe useful to you? Who knows.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ❗ **This module is not imported by default.**  
> It’s not in the GitHub releases. It’s not on PSGallery. It’s not manifesting via sheer will.  
> Clone the repo and import it manually if you're into that sort of thing.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Will it work on your machine? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
> Works on mine. That’s the QA process.

## 🛠️ Importing the module

I don't know, maybe

```powershell
Import-Module -Name modules\Fun.OCD\Fun.OCD.psd1 -Force
```

Assuming you are on the correct path and have the module cloned.

## 🧪 Testing (or lack thereof)

Absolutely zero tests.  
This code is powered by vibes. **Read it before you run it.** Seriously.

## 📚 Documentation

Some commands have docs.  
Some don’t.  
Some are just eldritch incantations with `-WhatIf`.  
You’ve been warned.

## ❓ Why this exists

Because I have OCD.  
Because I got tired of rewriting the same stuff on every machine.  
Because if I didn’t put this somewhere, I’d go feral.

That’s it! Have fun — `pwsh-fun` 😎  
*(P.S. Yes, I know this README is cringe. I’m leaning into it.)*
